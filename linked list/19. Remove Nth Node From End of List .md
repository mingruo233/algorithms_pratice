# 19. Remove Nth Node From End of List
[leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-nth-node-from-end-of-list/description/)
Constraints:
1. we want nth node from the end of the list. But we do not have doubly linked list, only single linked list. This means we can only loop through from start to end of the list.

Consider the example 1:
 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5

We want to move 2th node from the list. and the important node is not the nth node, it is the node before the nth node. Assuming there are two pointers, one points to the 3, one points to the 5, then the fast pointer moves 2 steps futher than the slow pointer.

Therefore, it is not hard to notice, to find the n+1th node from the list, we make 2 pointers, one of then move 2 steps ahead.

We will need a dummy_node, as we might need to remove the original head element.


```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution(object):
    def removeNthFromEnd(self, head, n):
        """
        :type head: Optional[ListNode]
        :type n: int
        :rtype: Optional[ListNode]
        """
        
        dummy_head =ListNode(next=head)
        fast = dummy_head
        slow = dummy_head

        for i in range(n): #we were gurantee 1<=n<=size, so dont worry about overflow. If we are not gurantee, will need if statement that return immidately if fast reaches to none
            fast=fast.next

        while fast.next: #if while loop breaks, it means it is the last element in the list
            fast=fast.next
            slow=slow.next
        
        slow.next=slow.next.next # slow will be at least one 1 step away from the end point
        return dummy_head.next

```
