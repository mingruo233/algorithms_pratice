#206 Reverse Linked List
[leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/description/)

Similar idea here. Consider reversing linked list
(node 1) -> (node 2) -> (node 3) -> ... -> (node n)

First step is the following
None <- (node 1) | (node 2) -> (node 3) -> ... -> (node n)
We now have two seperated linked list, where node 1 is prev, and cur is node 2. then connect cur.next = prev, we will have

None <- (node 1) <- (node 2) | (node 3) -> ... -> (node n)

Do this untill we reach a none. That means we are at the end of node after node n (or node n itself, if the length is 0)
we return prev because it either points to None or points to node n.

None <- (node 1) <- (node 2) <- (node 3) <- ... <- (node n) | None

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution(object):
    def reverseList(self, head):
        """
        :type head: Optional[ListNode]
        :rtype: Optional[ListNode]
        """
        cur = head
        prev = None
        while cur:
            temp=cur.next
            cur.next=prev
            prev=cur
            cur=temp
        return prev
```
