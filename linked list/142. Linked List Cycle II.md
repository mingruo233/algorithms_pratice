# 142. Linked List Cycle II
[leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle-ii/description/)

For this problem, I was stuck at after getting
1. x+z
2. x+n(y+z)+z

Unable to recgonize that 2(x+z) = x+n(y+z)+z

Anyway, convincing myself that slow and fast will meet before slow is the following:
(assumption, the start of linked list value 0 to 5)
<pre>
path of slow: 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5
path of fast: 0 -> 2 -> 4 -> 1 -> 3 -> 5
</pre>

Basically, the goal is same. changing the end point is basically

<pre>
path of slow: 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5
path of fast: 2 -> 4 -> 1 -> 3 -> 5 ->
</pre>

They will eventually meet before slow reaches to the n



```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution(object):
    def detectCycle(self, head):
        """
        :type head: ListNode
        :rtype: ListNode
        """
        slow=head
        fast=head

        while fast and fast.next:
            slow=slow.next
            fast=fast.next.next
            if slow == fast:
                slow=head
                check=fast
                while slow!=check:
                    slow=slow.next
                    check=check.next
                return slow

        return None



        
        
```
