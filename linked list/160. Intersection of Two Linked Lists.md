# 160. Intersection of Two Linked Lists
[leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/intersection-of-two-linked-lists/description/)
Constraint:
1. We need to compare the actual node itself

Consider two linked list:
a1 -> a2 -> c1 -> c2 -> c3
b1 -> b2 -> b3 -> c1 -> c2 -> c3

when trying to find the intersection (if exists), we want a pointers from A, another pointers from B, points to the intersection simultaneously. I.e we want the length to be same, so pointer from the start can reach to the end at same time

<pre>
      a1 -> a2 -> c1 -> c2 -> c3
b1 -> b2 -> b3 -> c1 -> c2 -> c3
</pre>

Then the algorithm is simple. Find lenA and lenB, move the longest one by the difference between A and B, then move until they are same or reach to the end

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution(object):
    def getIntersectionNode(self, headA, headB):
        """
        :type head1, head1: ListNode
        :rtype: ListNode
        """
        lenA = 0
        cur = headA
        while cur:
            cur=cur.next
            lenA+=1
        lenB = 0
        cur = headB
        while cur:
            cur=cur.next
            lenB+=1
        
        longhead = headA
        shorthead = headB
        difference = abs(lenA-lenB)
        if lenA<lenB:
            shorthead=headA
            longhead=headB
        
        for i in range(difference):
            longhead=longhead.next
        
        while longhead:
            if longhead==shorthead:
                return longhead
            longhead=longhead.next
            shorthead=shorthead.next
        return None
```
