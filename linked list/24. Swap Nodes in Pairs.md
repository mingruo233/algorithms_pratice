# 24. Swap Nodes in Pairs
[leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/swap-nodes-in-pairs/description/)

Consider some constraints of the problem:
1. We want to return its head, and the changes would involve head. Therefore, we will need dummy_head
2. We do not want to modify the values in the list (other wise we can use slow/fast pointer to tracks values of cur/prev) and swap it.

But we will still need to track the prev and cur, where cur = first node in the swap list, prev is the node before previous. Consider the following:
1. dummy -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> ... -> n
2. dummy -> 1 <-> 2 | 3 -> ...-> n
3. dummy -> 2 <-> 1 | 3 -> ... -> n
4. dummy -> 2 -> 1 -> 3 -> ... -> n

is how we swap two nodes.

Then cur will 1, prev will be dummy. we will need to move cur = cur.next so it is pointing to the next possible swap value (while loop ensure that if it is None or there is only one remaining node, it will not enter the while loop). prev is now the previous cur (which is  1 in the example)


```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution(object):
    def swapPairs(self, head):
        """
        :type head: Optional[ListNode]
        :rtype: Optional[ListNode]
        """
        
        dummy_head = ListNode(next=head)
        cur=head
        prev=dummy_head
        while cur and cur.next: 
            temp=cur.next.next
            cur.next.next=cur
            prev.next=cur.next
            cur.next=temp
            prev=cur
            cur=cur.next
        return dummy_head.next

        

```
