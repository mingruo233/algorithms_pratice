# 203. Remove Linked List Elements
[leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-linked-list-elements/)

I personally blieve this is a 2 pointer questions. Considering that we want to achieve the following to do the deletion:
1. find the node with value = target
2. find the node before the found node, called prev
3. set prev=node.next to delete it

Therefore, we will always need a pointer point to the previous node, and one points to the current node. Consider we do not have prev node before head, so we create a dummy_head to make life easier:)

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution(object):
    def removeElements(self, head, val):
        """
        :type head: Optional[ListNode]
        :type val: int
        :rtype: Optional[ListNode]
        """
        dummy_head = ListNode(next=head)
        cur = dummy_head.next
        prev = dummy_head

        while(cur): #ensure we do not got to the None
            if cur.val == val:
                prev.next=cur.next
            else:
                prev=cur
            cur=cur.next
            
        return dummy_head.next




```
