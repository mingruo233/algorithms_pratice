#59 Spirial Matrix II
[leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/spiral-matrix-ii/description/)

This is a stimulation problem, which I believe could be confusing at first. To look at easier test cases first before starting:
1. 2x2
2. 3x3
4. 4x4

The actions that we are taking to fill up the matrix is described by the following:
1. left to right
2. up to down
3. right to left
4. down to up

I personally prefer to make sure all four actions fill up exactly same number of cells. Therefore, for each row/column, there should be a remaining cell that would be the starting point of the next action.

One thing I found helpful would be draw the outer two layers of the array by using 0 and n.


```python
class Solution(object):
    def generateMatrix(self, n):
        """
        :type n: int
        :rtype: List[List[int]]
        """
        #left to right 1. [0,n-2] -> [0,n-1)
        #up to down       [0,n-2] -> [0,n-1)
        #right to left    [n-1,1] -> [n-1,0)
        #down to up       [n-1,1] -> [n-1,0]

        result = [[0] *n for _ in range(n)]
        start_x = 0
        start_y = 0

        loop = n//2 # check later
        value = 1
        for offset in range(loop):

            for y in range(start_y,n-1-offset):
                result[start_x][y] = value
                value+=1
            
            for x in range(start_x,n-1-offset):
                result[x][n-1-offset] = value
                value+=1
            
            for y in range(n-1-offset,start_y,-1):
                result[n-1-offset][y] = value
                value+=1

            for x in range(n-1-offset,start_x,-1):
                result[x][start_y] =value
                value+=1
            start_x+=1
            start_y+=1
        if n%2 !=0:
            mid = n//2
            result[mid][mid]=value
        return result


```
