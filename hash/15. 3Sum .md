# 15. 3sum

[leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum/description/)

Not really Intuitive, but sure.

There are some thinking here that lead to the following answer:

1. We could modify the array. If we could not, that will be much harder.

After that, we can think of sorting it, as we are trying to have it to reach to 0. i.e sorting it will allow us to modify the poinrter to increase/decrease the values compared to the randomly selecting from unsorted one.

This lead to the 2 point.

```python
class Solution(object):
    def threeSum(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: List[List[int]]
        """
        results = []
        nums.sort()

        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if i!=0 and nums[i] == nums[i-1]:
                continue
            dict_ = {}
            right = len(nums)-1
            left = i+1
            while(left<right):
                result = nums[i]+nums[left]+nums[right]
                if result == 0:
                    results.append([nums[i],nums[left],nums[right]])
                    left+=1
                    right-=1
                    while left<right and nums[left]==nums[left-1]:
                        left+=1
                    while left<right and nums[right]==nums[right+1]:
                        right-=1
                elif result>0:
                    right-=1
                else:
                    left+=1
        return results



```
