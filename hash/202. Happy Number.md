# 202. Happy Number

[leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/happy-number/description/)

No particular comment here, pretty intutive.

Was stuck on how to get 18 to 1^2+8^2, but was able to figure out!

Another approach is to use divmod

```python
class Solution(object):
    def isHappy(self, n):
        """
        :type n: int
        :rtype: bool
        """

        occurences = []
        while True:
            if n == 1:
                return True
            string = str(n)
            result = 0
            for num in string:
                result += int(num) ** 2
            if result in occurences:
                return False
            occurences.append(result)
            n = result




```
